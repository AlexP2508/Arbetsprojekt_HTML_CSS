      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Once upon a time, in a world where e-commerce dreams and wild imaginations collided, 
        three unlikely heroes came together with a peculiar idea and a zest for laughter. 
        Meet Simon, Alexander and Gustav – the masterminds behind the legendary wonderland of online shopping, SAG WonderWares!
      </p>
      <p>
        It all started when Simon, an eccentric inventor with a penchant for creating absurd contraptions, 
        found himself accidentally ordering a lifetime supply of rubber chickens while experimenting 
        with a new voice-activated shopping assistant. Determined not to let this poultry predicament go to waste, 
        Simon called upon his two best friends for an emergency brainstorming session.
      </p>
      </p>
        Gustav, the eternal optimist, and Alexander, the resident goofball, enthusiastically joined the rubber chicken party. 
        As they sat amidst a sea of squawking plastic fowls, the trio hatched a plan – why not turn their accidental 
        feathered frenzy into an e-commerce extravaganza? And thus, SAG WonderWares was born!

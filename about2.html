  <br />It all started when Simon, an eccentric inventor with a penchant for
  creating absurd contraptions, found himself accidentally ordering a lifetime
  supply of rubber chickens while experimenting with a new voice-activated
  shopping assistant. Determined not to let this poultry predicament go to
  waste, Simon called upon his two best friends for an emergency brainstorming
  session.

  <br />Gustav, the eternal optimist, and Alexander, the resident goofball,
  enthusiastically joined the rubber chicken party. As they sat amidst a sea of
  squawking plastic fowls, the trio hatched a plan â€“ why not turn their
  accidental feathered frenzy into an e-commerce extravaganza? And thus, SAG
  WonderWares was born!
